# healthmonitoring-naivebayes-(This code is still in progress)
The project is health monitoring system based on naivebayes algorithm and other document classification algorithms. Here we predict the disease based on the symptoms
given as input. In document classes you give input as various documents of different diseases. (Data is not provided here).
Rough code is provided here which predicts most probability document which contain the symptoms told by the person. In future we 
are planning to predict the disease based on the symptoms told by the person.Here input and output will be in voice format. 
App generally asks symptoms of person.Based on the symptoms we rougly estimate the disease he/she is suffering from based on 
DeepLearning with NaturalLanguageProcessing.
